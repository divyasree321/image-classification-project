# Brain Tumor & Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification

This project integrates two medical imaging classification tasks:
- **Brain Tumor Detection using MRI images**
- **Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray images**

## ðŸ“„ Overview
The project uses deep learning techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented in **Google Colab** using **TensorFlow/Keras**. It covers:
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Model architecture design
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy and loss visualization

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The final trained models achieved high accuracy on both medical imaging tasks with visualized performance metrics.

## ðŸ“š File Included
- `integrating_brain_tumour_with_chest_X_Ray_pneumonia.ipynb` : Complete Google Colab notebook with code and output.

## ðŸ”— How to Run
- Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
- Upload the dataset (if not already in Colab)
- Run all cells sequentially
